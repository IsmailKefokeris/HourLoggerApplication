# COM519 Assignment
## Hour Logger Application
### [Hosted Application - Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
### [Github repository](https://github.com/IsmailKefokeris/HourLoggerApplication)


## Introduction
The assessment tasked me to create, test, and deploy, a proof of concept data-driven full stack web-application. I was handed
the option to either make sense of existing data or solve a problem in my work or social life. I have chosen the latter. I will
be creating and designing a time logging app which will allow individual users to sign in and log hours worked from their job 
(indipendently from the company).

I am desiging and creating this because of a problem that a friend of mine ran into recently, they were paid after a months work but werent sure if they were paid the full correct amount, we painstakingly counted the days back tallying all the hours she had worked to figure out what they were owed. If only there were a tool easy to use and access that could have prevented this situation or atleast helped us in tallying.
